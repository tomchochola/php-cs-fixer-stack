✨ _**Clone and Win!**_

The PHPCSFixer Stack is a pre-configured set of rules and templates specifically tailored for PHP projects. It streamlines the process of setting up PHP-CS-Fixer, making it easy to enforce consistent coding standards and best practices across your PHP codebase without the hassle of manual configuration.

## What is PHPCSFixer Stack?

The PHPCSFixer Stack is part of the Premierstacks collection and serves as a foundational tool for ensuring high-quality PHP code across various projects. It provides pre-configured setups for PHP-CS-Fixer, a powerful tool that automatically fixes code style issues according to predefined rules.

The stack is structured to handle different environments and project types, whether you're working on a pure PHP application or a Laravel-based project. With specialized configurations for common coding patterns and best practices, it simplifies the process of setting up and maintaining code standards.

Unlike manually configuring PHP-CS-Fixer for every project, the PHPCSFixer Stack abstracts the complexity and provides ready-to-use configurations. You only need to install the package and choose the template that best fits your project’s needs. This approach not only saves time but also eliminates the potential for configuration errors, ensuring that all your PHP code adheres to a consistent style across different projects and development environments.

This is my personal GitHub profile, where you’ll find public documentation and sample repositories for proprietary packages and templates from Premierstacks. These public repositories are designed to give you an overview of the best practices and high-quality code I follow in all my projects.

## What is Premierstacks

[https://github.com/premierstacks](https://github.com/premierstacks)

Premierstacks is a collection of exclusive, proprietary stacks and templates for PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Laravel. It was created to address the common pain points developers face with many open-source projects—quality, consistency, and maintainability. With Premierstacks, you get high-quality tools built with strict attention to detail, designed to help you build and maintain better projects, faster.

## Why Premierstacks?

I created Premierstacks because I wasn’t satisfied with the quality of many open-source projects. Maintaining high-quality code and ensuring long-term reliability is challenging when you’re not earning from the product. When you pay for something, it means the creator truly cares about its success and is committed to delivering the best possible outcome.

Like Apple’s approach with their closed ecosystem, I believe that true excellence can only be achieved when every detail is under your control. That’s why Premierstacks is proprietary software—it's not just about providing solutions; it’s about ensuring those solutions meet the highest standards.
